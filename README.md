QRES provides an offline and powerful search of Queensland's Regional Ecosystem Description Database (REDD). This database is provided by the Queensland government and is released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Licence.  The database is available at https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/plants/ecosystems/descriptions/download

This app is primarily designed for field workers in remote areas (fully offline) and provides a more powerful search function than is available online through official channels.

Queensland is well known for its bright sunny days. Therefore, the app's colour scheme is designed for maximum visibility in sunshine. Although, actual visibility will depend to a large extent on your display type.

Regional ecosystems comprise three numbers separated by periods. The first number represents the bioregion. The second number is the Land Zone and the third identifies the vegetation community. For details see - https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/plants/ecosystems/descriptions/framework

Searches can include complete or partial RE numbers: e.g. "6.7." would limit the search to the Mulga Lands (bioregion 6) and Land Zone 7 (Cainozoic duricrusts). Adding other terms such as botanical names will further limit results.

Searches can include:
1) single or multiple RE numbers (e.g. 6.5.1) and/or
2) partial RE numbers (e.g. 6.5. 6.7.), and/or
3) descriptive text (e.g. Cainozoic), and/or
4) botanical names (e.g. Acacia aneura)
